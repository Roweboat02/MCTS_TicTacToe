Monte carlo tree search class and functions.
A game needs to have:
    Class attributes:
    SYMBOLS : iterable
        SYMBOLS Should include all differentiations between players.
        Is never used stricly as a class attribute, but must be constant.

    Object attributes:
    turn : obj from SYMBOLS (i.e. int, str, ect.)
        an object belonging to SYMBOLS which is used to denote which player
        is expected to make an action.
    winner : obj from SYMBOLS (i.e. int, str, ect.)
        an object belonging to SYMBOLS which is used to denote which player
        has won. Winner should be updated by game class after a state change.
    Methods:
    next_moves_list()
        Returns a list or array of all reachable states immediately after the current game state.
    copy()
        Returns an identical, entirely independant copy of the game in it's current state.
    make_move(move)
        Change from current game state to state described with move param.
    make_random_move()
        Change from current game state to an immediately reachable randomly selected state.
